#' Simulated transmission tree
#'
#' This dataset represents a simulated transmission tree.
#' This simulation was generated using the R package `o2groups` (see \url{https://github.com/CyGei/o2groups} for more information).
#' Group `HCW` is assortative with a gamma coefficient of 2 and group `patient` is disassortative with a gamma coefficient of 1/1.25.
#' Suceptible group sizes were 100 and 350, respectively.
#' Code to reproduce the data below:
#' ```
#' pacman::p_load_gh("CyGei/o2groups")
#' set.seed(123)
#' sim_tree <- o2groups::simulate_groups(
#'   duration = 100,
#'   group_n = 2,
#'   size = c(100, 350), # susceptible group sizes
#'   name = c("HCW", "patient"),
#'   gamma = c(2, 0.8), # assortativity coefficients
#'   intro_n = c(1, 3),
#'   r0 = c(2, 2),
#'   generation_time = c(0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1, 0),
#'   incubation_period = sample(1:14, 1000, replace = TRUE)
#' )
#'```
#' @format A data frame with 373 rows and 6 columns:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{group}{Character. The group to which the individual belongs.}
#'   \item{id}{Character. Unique identifier for each individual in the study.}
#'   \item{source}{Character. The ID of the individual who was the source of infection, if known. `NA` indicates an unknown source.}
#'   \item{source_group}{Character. The group of the source individual. `NA` for unknown sources.}
#'   \item{date_infection}{Numeric. The date of infection. Represented as the number of days since the start of the study.}
#'   \item{date_onset}{Numeric. The date of onset of symptoms. Represented as the number of days since the start of the study.}
#' }
#' @source This dataset is simulated (see R package `o2groups`) and does not correspond to real-world data.
