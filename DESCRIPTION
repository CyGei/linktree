Description: Estimates group transmission assortativity coefficients from transmission trees. 
    Group transmission assortativity coefficients measure the tendency for individuals to transmit 
    within their own group (e.g. age group, vaccination status, or location) compared to other groups. 
    The package requires information on who infected whom, group membership for all individuals, 
    and the relative sizes of each group in the population.
