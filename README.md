`linktree` is a novel framework that leverages transmission chain data
to estimate ***group transmission assortativity***; this quantifies the
extent to which individuals transmit within their own group compared to
others. The methodology is described in our
[paper](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0313037),
and briefly discussed on
[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib5dBunDPN0).

## Installation

[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:
